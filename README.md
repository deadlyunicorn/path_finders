### Path Finders is an app that helps you orientate yourself towards a point on the globe, by using a compass. It also shows you the approximate distance to that point! 
================================  

There are two ways to target a location and get your path towards it!

The first one is to add its Coordinates ( Decimal Degrees ) and use those.

The second way to target a location is to add a user ID. 
In order to fetch the location of a user this way, they should be actively sharing their location and not have lost connectivity in the last 30 minutes.

Generally the app does not require an internet connection, unless you decide to share your location or try to track another user by ID.

================================

### What does this app offer: Have you ever wanted a compass that points towards your desired location? This is what this app does, with an elegant and simple UI!
